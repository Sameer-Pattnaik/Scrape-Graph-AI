# ScrapeGraph AI Readme

## Introduction

ScrapeGraph AI is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of scraping data from websites. Using the SmartScrapeGrapher module, users can efficiently extract structured data from web pages and store it in a variety of formats. This readme will guide you through the setup, usage, and customization of ScrapeGraph AI.

## Installation

To install ScrapeGraph AI, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You can install ScrapeGraph AI using pip:

```sh
pip install scrapegraphai
```

## Getting Started

To get started with ScrapeGraph AI, you'll need to import the necessary modules and set up your scraping environment. Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from scrapegraphai import SmartScrapeGrapher

# Initialize the scraper
scraper = SmartScrapeGrapher()

# Define the URL to scrape
url = 'https://example.com'

# Scrape the data
data = scraper.scrape(url)

# Print the scraped data
print(data)
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

The following example demonstrates how to use ScrapeGraph AI to scrape a website and store the data in a JSON file:

```python
from scrapegraphai import SmartScrapeGrapher

# Initialize the scraper
scraper = SmartScrapeGrapher()

# Define the URL to scrape
url = 'https://example.com'

# Scrape the data
data = scraper.scrape(url)

# Save the data to a JSON file
with open('scraped_data.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(data, file, indent=4)

print("Data successfully scraped and saved to scraped_data.json")
```

### Advanced Usage

ScrapeGraph AI provides various options to customize the scraping process. Here’s an example of advanced usage:

```python
from scrapegraphai import SmartScrapeGrapher

# Initialize the scraper with custom settings
scraper = SmartScrapeGrapher(headers={'User-Agent': 'CustomUserAgent'}, timeout=10)

# Define the URL to scrape
url = 'https://example.com'

# Scrape the data with additional parameters
data = scraper.scrape(url, params={'category': 'news'})

# Process and save the data
# (Additional processing steps can be added here)

with open('scraped_data.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(data, file, indent=4)

print("Data successfully scraped and saved to scraped_data.json")
```

## Customization

You can customize the scraping behavior by passing additional parameters to the `SmartScrapeGrapher`:

- **headers**: Set custom headers for the HTTP requests.
- **timeout**: Specify a timeout for the HTTP requests.
- **params**: Add URL parameters to the scraping requests.

```python
scraper = SmartScrapeGrapher(headers={'User-Agent': 'CustomUserAgent'}, timeout=10)
```

## Caching

To avoid repeated scraping from the same website, you can implement caching using Python’s LRU cache decorator:

```python
from functools import lru_cache
from scrapegraphai import SmartScrapeGrapher

# Initialize the scraper
scraper = SmartScrapeGrapher()

# Define a cached scrape function
@lru_cache(maxsize=32)
def cached_scrape(url):
    return scraper.scrape(url)

# Scrape the data using the cached function
url = 'https://example.com'
data = cached_scrape(url)

print(data)
```

## Handling Missing or Empty Content

If `html_content` is missing or empty, you can handle it gracefully within your application:

```python
def handle_scrape(url):
    data = scraper.scrape(url)
    if not data or 'html_content' not in data or not data['html_content']:
        print("No content found or content is empty")
        return None
    return data

url = 'https://example.com'
data = handle_scrape(url)

if data:
    print(data)
```

## Storing Cached Data

You can store cached data in a local file for persistent caching:

```python
import json
import os
from functools import lru_cache

cache_file_path = 'cache_data.json'

def save_cache_to_file(cache):
    with open(cache_file_path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(cache, f)

def load_cache_from_file():
    if os.path.exists(cache_file_path):
        with open(cache_file_path, 'r') as f:
            return json.load(f)
    return {}

# Initialize the cache
cache = load_cache_from_file()

@lru_cache(maxsize=32)
def cached_scrape(url):
    if url in cache:
        return cache[url]
    data = scraper.scrape(url)
    cache[url] = data
    save_cache_to_file(cache)
    return data

# Scrape the data using the cached function
url = 'https://example.com'
data = cached_scrape(url)

print(data)
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please refer to the following common problems and solutions:

- **Issue:** Scraper returns empty or missing content.
  - **Solution:** Ensure the URL is correct and the website allows scraping. Check for any changes in the website's structure.

- **Issue:** Caching not working as expected.
  - **Solution:** Verify that the cache file is accessible and the cache logic is correctly implemented.
