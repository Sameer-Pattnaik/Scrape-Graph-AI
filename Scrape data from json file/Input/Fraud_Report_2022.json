In 2021, CNP fraud increased by 7.6% on the previous year, counterfeit/skimming fell by 50.8% to a record low, and fraudulent applications dropped significantly (65.6%), as a result of the technological and security mitigants adopted by industry. After a 24.6% fall in 2020, lost/stolen card fraud rose by 9.3%, which may be linked to increased opportunities for fraudsters associated with Australians having emerged from COVID-19 lockdowns."

CNP fraud now accounts for 91% of all Australian card fraud, which is in line with the global trend of growing online card fraud and cybercrime in general. The following are key reasons for global growth.",
            "Chip technology continues to be effective in combatting fraud on Australian cards. Counterfeit/skimming fraud fell for the fifth consecutive year, down to $5.5 million in 2021 \u2013 a 90.7% drop from a peak of $59.2 million in 2016. As card fraud becomes more difficult for criminals to perpetrate, there is a shift towards scams and buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) fraud. Additionally, friendly/first party fraud occurs when customers dishonestly claim to have not received goods or, during a returns dispute with a merchant, claim the transaction is fraudulent. Industry reports that friendly/first party fraud is becoming a greater issue. AusPayNet is working with industry to obtain further insights and mitigate these threats."
